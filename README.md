This webapp was completed by Catheryn Celaya and Joe Cassiere for "Family & Friends Night" at Wyncode Academy.

PhotoIt is a geolocation-based picture app.  Users can upload and vote on others' pictures.

The main page displays the most popular pictures uploaded in the user's area within the last 24 hours.  Pictures older than 24 hours and from other areas can be found on other pages on the site.

The site can be found at https://photoit.herokuapp.com/
